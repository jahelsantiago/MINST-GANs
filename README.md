# MINST-GANs

In this project we created a GAN that can generate images based on the Minst data set.


For this purpose we created 2 simple neural networks, a discriminator and a generator the first one generates images from noise and the second one classifies the given images into real and fake images and gives feedback to the generator model.

**Results**:
The final loss in the generator was 2.3 and in the discriminator 0.3.

Here you can see some example of the generated images:
